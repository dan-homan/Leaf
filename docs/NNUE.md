# Epoch NNUE Evaluation — Implementation Notes

## Overview

Epoch can use a Stockfish-compatible NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Network) for
position evaluation in place of its classical hand-crafted eval. The implementation
supports the **HalfKAv2_hm** format used by Stockfish 15/16 era networks.

Build with NNUE enabled:

```sh
g++ -o Epoch src/Epoch.cc -O3 -D VERS="dev" -D TABLEBASES=1 -D NNUE=1 -pthread
```

or via the build script:

```sh
perl comp.pl 2026_03_07a NNUE=1 
```

The network file currently defaults to `nn-ad9b42354671.nnue` (Stockfish 15.1 release, 47 MB) which must be in
the same directory as the binary, or in the directory from which the engine is launched. 
It can be downloaded from: https://github.com/official-stockfish/networks. Other compatitible networks can be 
specified with the compile variable NNUE_NET=filename.

When NNUE is not compiled in (`-D NNUE=0` or omitted), the classical eval is used
unchanged.  When NNUE is compiled in but the network file is not found, the engine falls
back to classical eval automatically.

## Network Architecture (HalfKAv2_hm)

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Feature set | HalfKAv2_hm: 32 king-buckets × 704 piece-square indices = **22,528 features** |
| Feature transformer (FT) | 22,528 → 1,024 int16 per perspective + 8 int32 PSQT per perspective |
| Layer stacks | 8 stacks selected by `(piece_count − 1) / 4`, each: |
| FC0 | 1,024 → 16 (SqrCReLU-only input: 512 per perspective × 2 = 1,024) |
| FC1 | 30 → 32 (dual-activation of FC0 outputs 0–14) |
| FC2 | 32 → 1 (output; FC0 output-15 adds directly as passthrough) |
| Activation | SqrCReLU (outputs 0–14) + CReLU (outputs 0–14, appended) |

**King orientation (HalfKAv2_hm):** each perspective horizontally mirrors the board
when the own king is on the queen side (files a–d), so the king always appears on files
e–h.  The Epoch convention uses `orient = ((ksq_f & 7) < 4) ? 7 : 0` where `ksq_f`
is the king square after rank-flip for the BLACK perspective.

**Own king as feature:** the own king IS included as a feature (PS_KING = 640 slot),
identical to the enemy king entry.  Both kings contribute to the accumulator for their
respective perspectives.

## Score Formula

The output follows the Stockfish 15.1 formula exactly:

```
value_internal = (psqt_diff / 2 + positional) / OutputScale(16)   [Stockfish Value units]
centipawns     = value_internal × 100 / NormalizeToPawnValue(361)
               = (psqt_diff / 2 + positional) × 100 / 5776
```

where:
- `psqt_diff = psqt[stm][stack] − psqt[opp][stack]`
- `positional = fc2_out + fwdOut`
- `fwdOut = fc0_raw[15] × 9600 / 8128`  (passthrough; `600×OutputScale / (127×WeightScaleBits)`)
- `5776 = 16 × 361`

Relevant quantization constants in `nnue.h`:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `NNUE_WEIGHT_SHIFT` | 6 | FC weight quantization: raw int32 >> 6 → [0,127] range |
| `NNUE_SQR_SHIFT` | 7 | SqrCReLU shift: `fc0_raw² >> (2×6+7=19)` → [0,127] |

**SqrCReLU detail:** the raw int32 fc0 value is squared *before* clamping:
`output = clamp(0, 127, fc0_raw² >> 19)`.  This matches Stockfish's `SqrClippedReLU`
exactly — negative fc0 values produce non-zero squared outputs.

`nnue_evaluate()` returns a score from the **side-to-move's perspective** (positive =
good for the side to move).  The score hash stores values in **White's perspective**;
conversion at store/retrieve: `score_w = wtm ? score : -score`.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Score hash integration (+22% NPS, 528K → 646K)

The NNUE branch in `score_pos` probes the existing `score_table` before calling
`nnue_evaluate`, and stores results after.  About 26–38% of evaluation calls are served
from the hash, avoiding both the forward pass and the dirty-accumulator refresh.

### 2. FC0 vdotq reordering (+7% NPS, 646K → 692K)

FC0 weights are reordered at load time to a "vdotq-friendly" layout:

```
l0_weights[s][ib*64 + ob*16 + k*4 + j]
```

where `ib = i/4`, `j = i%4`, `ob = o/4`, `k = o%4`.  The forward pass uses four
`vdotq_s32` NEON calls per 4-input block, accumulating into all 16 output registers
simultaneously (vs. 16 separate passes the compiler would generate).  Requires
`-D __ARM_FEATURE_DOTPROD` (available automatically on Apple M1/M2/M3 with the system
toolchain; no `-march=native` needed).

### 3. NEON fused dual-activation + vdotq FC1 (+4% NPS, 692K → ~720K)

**Dual activation (step 1):** The two scalar loops producing 3,072 int8 values from the
int16 accumulator were replaced with a single fused NEON loop per perspective.  One pass
reads `a[0..511]` and `a[512..1023]` together and writes all three output slices
(SqrCReLU and both CReLU halves) in 64 `int16x8` iterations instead of 1,536 scalar
iterations.

**FC1 vdotq (step 4):** FC1 weights (32×32 int8) are reordered at load time using the
same `ib*128 + ob*16 + k*4 + j` scheme.  The forward pass uses 8 `int32x4` accumulators
and 8 iterations of 8 `vdotq_s32` calls, replacing the 32×32 scalar loop.

### 4. Root-accumulator dirty fix (correctness, ~0% NPS)

At both search-root initialisation sites in `search.cpp` the accumulator dirty flags are
explicitly forced to `true` before calling `nnue_init_accumulator`.  Without this, if the
engine searched a position and then the game advanced to a new position, the stale
accumulator values from the previous position would be silently reused (dirty flags were
still `false` from the previous search).

### 5. Lazy accumulator evaluation (+17% NPS, ~720K → ~840K)

`nnue_apply_delta` replaces the temporary full-refresh stub with true one-level-lazy
incremental evaluation.  The search wiring was already in place (v2026_03_02b added
`nnue_record_delta` calls at all `exec_move` sites and the `nnue_apply_delta` guard before
`score_pos`); this optimization completes the implementation.

**At every `exec_move`:** `nnue_record_delta` stores ≤4 feature-index integers per
perspective into `acc.add/sub` arrays (no `ft_weights` access) and sets `acc.computed=false`.

**At `score_pos` time only:** `nnue_apply_delta` copies the parent's accumulator (2KB per
perspective) and applies the stored deltas via `add_feat`/`sub_feat`.  For king moves
(`need_refresh[p]=true`), the king's own perspective is rebuilt from scratch; the opponent
perspective is still incremental.

Cut nodes — roughly 58% of all nodes — now pay only a handful of integer assignments
instead of a 4KB copy plus 1K `add_feat`/`sub_feat` calls into the 46 MB `ft_weights`
table.

### 6. King-capture lazy accumulator fix (correctness, v2026_03_06z)

When a king *captures* a piece (`Kxf7` etc.), `nnue_record_delta` was only recording the
king's movement (sub from-square, add to-square) but omitting the subtraction of the
captured piece from the opponent's incremental accumulator.  Fix: added `if (capt_pt)`
capture subtraction in the king-move branch of both `nnue_record_delta` and
`nnue_update_accumulator`.  Verified via `NNUE_CHECK_LAZY` across multiple positions
including king-capture sequences.

### 7. Own-king feature inclusion (correctness, v2026_03_07a)

`halfkav2_feature()` was returning −1 (skip) for the own king, but Stockfish includes the
own king as a feature in the PS_KING = 640 slot, the same as the enemy king.  Removing
the exclusion gives correct feature indices and accumulator values for all positions.
This was a major source of evaluation error.

### 8. SqrCReLU: square raw value before clamping (correctness, v2026_03_07a)

The dual-activation loop was computing `v = clamp(0,127, fc0>>6); sq = v²>>7` — clamping
to `[0,127]` *before* squaring, which zeroed all negative fc0 values.  Stockfish's
`SqrClippedReLU` squares the raw int32 value first:
`output = clamp(0, 127, fc0_raw² >> 19)`.  Many fc0 outputs are strongly negative (e.g.
−13,000 to −8,000 in typical middlegame positions); these now contribute 127 to FC1 input
instead of 0, dramatically improving the positional component of the evaluation.

## NPS Benchmarks

8-second `analyze` from the starting position, Apple M1 (arm64), single thread:

| Binary | NPS | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| EXchess_classic (no NNUE) | 1,645,247 | baseline |
| v2026_03_01b | 528,348 | NNUE, no optimizations |
| v2026_03_01c | 645,539 | + score hash (+22%) |
| v2026_03_01e | 691,200 | + score hash + vdotq FC0 (+31% total) |
| v2026_03_02b | ~720,000 | + NEON dual-act + vdotq FC1 + root dirty fix (+36% total) |
| v2026_03_02c | ~840,000 | + lazy accumulator (+59% vs baseline) |
| v2026_03_02f | ~870,000 | + singular-extension accumulator fix (correctness) |
| v2026_03_07a | ~870,000 | + own-king fix + SqrCReLU fix + unified scale (correctness) |

Remaining gap vs. classical: **~1.9×**.  At a 1-minute time control the NNUE version
typically searches approximately 1–2 plies shallower than the classical version.

## TDLeaf(λ) Online Training

All NNUE layers (FC0/FC1/FC2, FT biases, FT weights, PSQT) can be trained via
TDLeaf(λ) self-play.  See `docs/TDLEAF.md` for the full reference.
Build with `NNUE=1 TDLEAF=1`.

The `scripts/training_run.py` interactive script manages a full training run: net
selection or random init, building both a training and a read-only binary, running
N iterations of M-game self-play matches via `scripts/match.py`, tracking cumulative game
counts across sessions, and exporting the trained weights to a new `.nnue` file named
`<net_base>-<total_games>g.nnue`.  Fischer Random (Chess960) is the default opening
randomisation method.

### Fresh network initialization (`--init-nnue`)

When starting from scratch, run:
```sh
perl src/comp.pl init NNUE=1 TDLEAF=1 OVERWRITE
./run/Epoch_vinit --init-nnue --write-nnue learn/nn-fresh.nnue
```

**FC / FT weights:** drawn from Gaussian distributions whose parameters were
measured empirically from the Stockfish 15.1 network (`nn-ad9b42354671.nnue`).

**PSQT weights:** initialised from the classical evaluator's piece values (`score.h`),
signed by perspective: own pieces (`pside == persp`) receive `+V`, opponent pieces receive `−V`.

| Piece  | Classical (cp) | int32 units (`cp × 5776/100`) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Pawn   | 100 cp        | 5,776                         |
| Knight | 377 cp        | 21,776                        |
| Bishop | 399 cp        | 23,046                        |
| Rook   | 596 cp        | 34,425                        |
| Queen  | 1197 cp       | 69,144                        |
| King   | 0 cp          | 0                             |

This gives TDLeaf a principled, deterministic starting point that matches Epoch's own
material scale, rather than random values with no positional content.
Key hyperparameters (in `src/tdleaf.h`):

| Constant | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `TDLEAF_ALPHA` | 200 | Learning rate for FC and FT layers |
| `NNUE_FT_LR_SCALE` | 1.0 | FT accumulator LR multiplier (no extra scale needed) |
| `NNUE_PSQT_LR_SCALE` | 10000 | PSQT LR multiplier (large: PSQT bypasses FC chain) |
| `NNUE_FC_BIAS_LR_SCALE` | 1000 | FC bias LR multiplier (wtm_sign cancellation fix) |
| `NNUE_FT_BIAS_LR_SCALE` | 10 | FT bias LR multiplier (shared-bias cancellation fix) |
| `TDLEAF_LAMBDA` | 0.7 | Eligibility trace decay |
| `TDLEAF_K` | 400 | Sigmoid temperature (cp) |
