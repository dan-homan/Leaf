## TDLeaf(λ) Training

### LR decay via update counts or other schedule

Explore mechanisms to reduce the effective learning rate as training progresses,
so that early games make large corrections and later games make smaller refinements:

- **Count-based Kalman (already implemented as Phase 1 in BAYESIAN_UPDATE.md):**
  `K = P0 / (P0 + cnt × R)` decays the per-weight Kalman gain from 1 → 0 as the
  per-weight update count `cnt` grows.  Currently bypassed because `TDLEAF_BAYES_R = 1.0`
  and `TDLEAF_MAX_UPDATE_FRAC = 1.0` together act as a flat cap rather than a schedule.
  Worth enabling properly and ablating against the flat-LR baseline.

- **Global step schedule:** a single session-level counter (games played) driving a
  shared LR multiplier — simpler than per-weight counts, easier to reason about.

- **Cosine / polynomial decay:** standard ML schedules applied to `TDLEAF_ALPHA` or
  the Kalman P0/R ratio.

- **Adam with appropriate LR:** Adam was attempted (see ADAM_UPDATE.md) but proved
  unstable for pre-trained weights because it amplifies small near-zero gradients to a
  full ±LR step.  Revisit with a much smaller LR (e.g. 0.01–0.05) or gradient
  clipping before Adam normalisation.

### Learning rate tuning
The current LR scales are initial guesses and have not been systematically tuned.
PSQT in particular appears to learn very slowly — `NNUE_PSQT_LR_SCALE` raised to 10000
(from 1000) to accelerate PSQT learning; further tuning may be needed.  FT bias
(`NNUE_FT_BIAS_LR_SCALE = 10`) and FC bias (`NNUE_FC_BIAS_LR_SCALE = 1000`) scales
similarly benefit from empirical testing.  A short grid search varying each scale
independently across 500–1000-game runs would establish good defaults.

### Learning rate scales and delta clamping
`NNUE_PSQT_LR_SCALE` and `NNUE_FC_BIAS_LR_SCALE` have been dialled back from
5000 → 1000 (2026-03-12) in preparation for symmetric self-play, where the
effective gradient signal per unit time doubles.  `TDLEAF_REPLAY_K` was also
reduced from 2 → 1 for the same reason.

Still open:
- `TDLEAF_MAX_UPDATE_FRAC` is currently 1.0 (disabled).  A tighter per-update
  clamp (e.g. 0.10–0.20) could prevent large individual games from dominating
  the accumulated gradient under concurrent two-engine training.
- Run a symmetric training run and inspect delta magnitudes via
  `compare_nnue_learning.py` (the new FC bias page is useful here) to confirm
  the dialled-back scales are not still too aggressive.
- If instability persists, consider halving `TDLEAF_ALPHA` next.

### Epoch-based replay for TDLeaf training

The current TDLeaf implementation is fully online: weights are updated after
each game and the game record is discarded.  A cheap alternative is to store
each game's leaf positions after self-play and make K additional passes through
them, recomputing the NNUE evaluation at each stored leaf with the updated
weights and applying the TD error on each pass.  The search is not re-run —
only the forward and backward NNUE passes at the fixed stored positions.

**Cost estimate (Flavor B — fixed leaves, recompute NNUE only):**
- Per-position: ~1–5 μs forward pass + ~10–15 μs backward pass
- Per-game (~80 leaf positions): ~1 ms per epoch
- 4,000 games × 10 epochs ≈ 40 seconds of additional compute — negligible

**Memory:**
- Storing board states only (accumulator recomputed each pass): ~160 MB for 4,000 games
- Storing accumulators (2 × 1024 int16 per position): ~1.3 GB for 4,000 games

**Caveats:**
- TDLeaf is on-policy: the stored leaf positions were found by an earlier
  version of the network.  Re-using them with updated weights is an off-policy
  approximation.  Empirically (cf. experience replay in DQN) this works well
  for small K, but degrades as the stored positions become stale relative to
  the current network.  K = 2–5 is a reasonable starting range; beyond ~5
  epochs over the same data instability is likely.
- The leaf *positions* themselves would change if the search were re-run with
  updated weights.  Flavor B accepts this as an approximation in exchange for
  the large reduction in compute cost vs. re-running the full search (Flavor A),
  which would cost the same as replaying all games × number of epochs.

**✓ Implemented (2026-03-11).** Flavor B is live with `TDLEAF_REPLAY_K` and
`TDLEAF_REPLAY_BUF_N=8` configurable at build or run time.

**Ablation results:**

| K | Result |
|---|--------|
| 0 | Baseline (no replay) — much weaker |
| 2 | **Best — adopted as default** |
| 3 | Slightly worse than K=2 |
| 6 | Large regression |

K=2 was marginally better than K=1 and substantially better than K=0.  K=6
caused a large regression, consistent with the expected instability when stored
positions become stale relative to the current network.  The default has been
reduced to K=1 in `src/define.h` as a more conservative choice for symmetric
self-play, where the doubled gradient signal makes additional replay passes
more likely to compound instability.

### Horizon noise mitigation — ablation testing plan

Two mechanisms were added to reduce the influence of tactics-beyond-horizon on TD
errors: score-change clipping (`TDLEAF_SCORE_CLIP_CP`) and ID-stability weighting
(`TDLEAF_ID_VAR_SIGMA2`).  Their contributions should be isolated before committing
to the combined defaults.

**Recommended ablation (500 games per arm, same starting network):**

| Arm | TDLEAF_SCORE_CLIP_CP | TDLEAF_ID_VAR_SIGMA2 | Description |
|-----|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| A (baseline) | 1e6 (disabled) | 1e6 (disabled) | Original algorithm |
| B (clip only) | 200 cp | 1e6 (disabled) | Approach 1 only |
| C (ID weight only) | 1e6 (disabled) | 10 000 cp² | Approach 2 only |
| D (combined) | 200 cp | 10 000 cp² | Both active (current default) |

**Metric:** Elo gain per game vs. the starting network (use `bayeselo_ratings.py` on
a 100-game test match against the starting network after each 500-game training run).

**Override hyperparameters at build time:**

```sh
# Arm A — no mitigation
perl comp.pl train_arm_a NNUE=1 NNUE_NET=nn-start.nnue TDLEAF=1 \
  -D TDLEAF_SCORE_CLIP_CP=1000000.0f -D TDLEAF_ID_VAR_SIGMA2=1000000.0f

# Arm B — clip only
perl comp.pl train_arm_b NNUE=1 NNUE_NET=nn-start.nnue TDLEAF=1 \
  -D TDLEAF_SCORE_CLIP_CP=200.0f -D TDLEAF_ID_VAR_SIGMA2=1000000.0f
```

(Similarly for arms C and D.)

**After the ablation:** if one approach dominates, drop the other to reduce
complexity.  If both help, the combined default is confirmed.

### ~~Bias initialisation~~ ✓ Implemented (2026-03-11)
FC biases (FC0/FC1/FC2) and FT biases are now initialised to zero in `--init-nnue` mode.
Random N(μ,σ) from the SF15.1 distribution provided no useful prior and added noise
that TDLeaf must overcome via its near-cancelling per-game gradient structure.  FT
weights still use random init so SqrCReLU activations are non-zero from game 1.

### Search parameter tuning
The search's pruning parameters (null-move margins, futility thresholds, aspiration
windows, LMR reduction tables) were tuned for the classical eval.  The NNUE eval has a
different score distribution and may benefit from re-tuning these constants.  CLOP or
a self-play tournament with systematic variation would be the appropriate approach.

---

## NNUE Infrastructure

### Pawn hash under NNUE
The classical eval stores pawn structure scores in a pawn hash table.  The NNUE eval
bypasses classical eval entirely, so `pawn hash hits` is always 0 in NNUE mode and the
pawn hash memory (≈19 MB) is wasted.  Disabling or shrinking it at build time when
`NNUE=1` would recover that memory (no effect on playing strength).

### search.par revision
Review whether `search.par` is still the right mechanism for runtime configuration —
consider what parameters are still relevant, whether the file format should be updated,
and how it interacts with xboard/cutechess invocation.

### ~~Linux compilation~~ ✓ RESOLVED (2026-03-11)
AVX2 x86-64 SIMD paths added to `nnue.cpp` for SqrCReLU, FC0, and FC1.
Fallback chain is now: NEON (ARM) → AVX2 (x86-64 with `-mavx2`) → scalar.
Default build uses `-march=x86-64-v3`; use `NATIVE=1` for CPU-native tuning.

### Multi-thread accumulator correctness
The SMP search allocates one `ts_thread_data` per thread, each with its own
`search_node n[MAXD+1]` stack including per-node accumulators.  Each thread's root
accumulator is independently initialised.  Thread interactions have not been tested
under NNUE; correctness is expected but unverified with `THREADS > 1`.
